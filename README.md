BB React App Boilerplate
===================
This boilerplate is the basic setup for a react app, built with npm and webpack, you can build out a dev version and a production version.

----------


How to build
-------------

1) **'npm install'**

2) **'npm run dev'** (this will build out the app, inc. styles and move images and plugins into the dist folder) 

To build the prod version just run:
**'npm run build'**

If you want to then test your prod app you can run a little node express server by:
**'node server'** or **'npm run serve'**
